# DSA â€“ LeetCode Practice

This repo contains my LeetCode problem solutions synced automatically using [LeetSync](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync).

Each problem is saved in its own folder, with:
- `solution.py`: My solution
- `metadata.json`: Problem info (title, difficulty, tags)

## Notes

I often redo problems, so some folders may have multiple solution files like `solution_2.py`, `solution_3.py`, etc.

## Purpose

To build consistency with data structures & algorithms and track progress over time.
